## ScriptDown
LibreScript uses a Markdown like language called ScriptDown and has the following commands:

- `&` to write the number and title of the screen
- `=` can be used for action, scene header, plane or description
- `-` to write the character name
- `_` to write the dialogue of the character

The following example was made with the following text in ScripDown
```r
& 1. SCENE 1
= A character comes into the room and proceeds to talk
- CHARACTER
_ I am a character, and this is my dialogue.
```
